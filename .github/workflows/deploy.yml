    steps:
      # 1. Checkout your repository's code
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # 2. Set up Node.js. Caching is enabled for faster installs in subsequent runs.
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:

      # 3. Install dependencies using 'npm ci' for faster, more reliable installs
      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: npm ci

      # 4. Build the Next.js application (this will also run your 'prebuild' script)
      - name: Build Project
        run: npm run build

      # 5. Create a .nojekyll file. This is crucial to prevent GitHub Pages
      # from ignoring files that start with an underscore (like Next.js's '_next' folder)
      - name: Add .nojekyll file
        run: touch out/.nojekyll

      # 6. Configure GitHub Pages
