feat: Rename project from grantha-vibhrama to grantha-explorer

Updated all occurrences of the project name from "grantha-vibhrama" to "grantha-explorer"
across the codebase. This includes:
- package.json and package-lock.json
- TECH-STACK.md
- DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md (title and basePath configuration)

This change aligns the project name consistently throughout the repository.
